I am a PhD student in the Morpheo team at Inria Grenoble Rhône-Alpes. 
My thesis is part of a collaboration between Facebook Reality Labs (former Oculus Research) in San Francisco, USA and Morpheo team.
I am supervised by Stefanie Wuhrer and Edmond Boyer (Inria Morpheo) and Tony Tung (Facebook Reality Labs).

My general areas of interest are computer vision and deep learning. My research focuses on 3D/4D modeling of dressed humans.

Before starting my PhD, I have worked for 1 year at Wrnch, as a computer vision engineer. In 2018 I graduated from Polytechnique Montréal (Master of Applied Science in Computer Science) and Université de Technologie de Compiègne (French Engineer degree in Computer Science). I did my Master Thesis at the Distributed Open Reliable Systems Analysis Lab from Polytechnique and work on performance analysis for machine learning dataflow applications executing in heterogeneous environments. I have also spent 6 months as an exchange student at Technische Universität Graz in Austria.
