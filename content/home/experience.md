    description: I worked on several computer vision applications that use human pose estimation and on a multi-camera platform for 3D markerless motion capture (multi cameras calibration, video feed synchronization, 3D estimation from several 2D poses).
  
  - title: Master Thesis
    company: DORSAL Polytechnique Montreal

    description: I developped performance analysis tools for machine learning dataflow applications executing in heterogeneous environments. I focused on the library TensorFlow and its dataflow computation graph. The goal was to develop tools which will help to understand the performance of the applications and to detect limiting elements or bottlenecks. A main aspect was to insure that the available hardware (CPUs and GPUs) is used efficiently.
