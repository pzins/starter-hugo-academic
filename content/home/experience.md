experience:
  - title: PhD Student in Computer Vision
    company: Inria
    company_url: 'https://www.inria.fr/'
    company_logo:
    location: Grenoble, France
    date_start: '2019-10-01'
    date_end: '2022-10-01'
    description: I am working on 3D/4D reconstruction of dressed humans.
        
  - title: Computer Vision Engineer
    company: Wrnch
    company_url: 'https://wrnch.ai/'
    company_logo: 
    location: Montreal, Canada
    date_start: '2018-10-01'
    date_end: '2019-05-01'
    description: I worked on several computer vision applications that use human pose estimation and on multi-cameras for 3D markerless motion capture (multi cameras calibration, video feed synchronization, 3D estimation from several 2D poses).
  
  - title: Master Thesis
    company: DORSAL Polytechnique Montreal
    company_url: 'https://www.dorsal.polymtl.ca/fr/'
    company_logo: 
    location: Montreal, Canada
    date_start: '2017-01-01'
    date_end: '2018-08-01'
    description: I developped performance analysis tools for machine learning dataflow applications executing in heterogeneous environments. I focused on the library TensorFlow and its dataflow computation graph. The goal was to develop tools which will help to understand the performance of the applications and to detect limiting elements or bottlenecks. A main aspect was to insure that the available hardware (CPUs and GPUs) is used efficiently.
